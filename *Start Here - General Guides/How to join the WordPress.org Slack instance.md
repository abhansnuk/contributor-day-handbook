# How to join the WordPress.org Slack instance

## What is Slack?

Slack is an online collaborative communication tool, which is used by the teams that make WordPress.org. You can access it on a web browser or through the Slack app. It is free to join. 

Here is all the information you will need to get started. You will need a WordPress.org account to be able to join the WordPress Slack - you can find out how in its handbook guide.

## How do I join?

Create a WordPress Slack account:
1. Visit make.wordpress.org/chat/
2. Log in using your WordPress.org account details
3. After logging in, scroll to “Join the WordPress team on Slack” and enter either your email address or choose the option ‘I understand, please send me an invite.’ :

Note: we recommend that you use the same username for Slack as you use for WordPress.org, though it is possible to use a different one.

The email address associated with your Slack username will be: [wporgusername]@chat.wordpress.org. Make a note of this as it will be important if you forget your password.

4. Check your inbox for an invitation link to Slack. Click ‘Join Now’ in the email and fill in your First Name (the name that will be displayed - this can also be changed later) and enter a Password:

7. It can be helpful to update your Slack profile by adding some details about your WordPress interests and timezone to help team members welcome and connect with you. To do this:
* Click on your name in the top left corner of the Slack screen
* Choose ‘Profile and Account’
* Choose ‘Edit Profile’
* Upload a photo to help people recognize you. 
8. Welcome to the WordPress.org community on Slack.

## Staying connected on Slack
You can set your status under ‘Profile’ so others know if you are available.

Slack notifications keep you informed about messages that might be of interest to you. By default, you will receive notifications when you receive a direct message, when someone @-mentions you in a channel, or when someone @-mentions a channel you are in.   

You can edit which notifications you receive by changing your preferences. To do this, click on the name of the Slack instance in the top left corner of the page and click on ‘Preferences’:
